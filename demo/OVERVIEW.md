# Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
CyberPulse

## ðŸš€ Summary
``` c

CyberPulse assists novice internet users by helping them scan and verify internet resources they are unsure of, such as domain names, emails, messages, and links. Users earn points by improving their security knowledge through quizzes and regular app use, and also gain points for contributing to the community by reporting and flagging new threats, recognizing that cybercrime constantly evolves. The application empowers users to protect themselves and others, fostering a safer online environment through education, gamification, and community-driven threat intelligence.
```

## âœ¨ Key Features
``` c
1.) WHOIS domain analysis
2.) Leaderboard and point system
3.) Community reporting and flagging
4.) Email spoofing detection
5.) Security quizzes
6.) Phishing detection for links, emails, and messages
7.) User authentication and XP tracking

```

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
Inspired by students getting scammed by emails, messages, and websites offering fake bursaries, free items, and fraudulent promises to change marks for a fee.
Students are often naive, desparate and under a lot of strain and thus fall victim to the unmerciful claws of the internet.
```

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
``` c
Integrate with service providers to allow users to track their cellphones using IMEI numbers (with strict authorization, only for devices registered in their name)
Group accounts for organizations to help prevent employees from falling victim to recurring threats
```
